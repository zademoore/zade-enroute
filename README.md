This is an eCommerce website. I have mounted the Solidus eCommerce engine to handle,
all eCommerce functionallity. 
Some feautures to be added to my main app are 
a simple blog that allows users to comment, 
and an image uploader for the "lookbook" section. 
Most likely I will use the carrierwave gem
to handle my uploads. 

I will be using the solidus_auth_devise to handle all of my authentication needs.
Thus enabling customers to shop as well as comment on blog posts.
